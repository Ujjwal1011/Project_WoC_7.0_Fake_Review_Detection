      "Content: He likes the pointelle knit to add interest to the shirt (not just flat or rib knit). The fit runs slightly large but he likes a looser fit. The button holes are somewhat loose so I suggest washing this shirt in a knit bag for delicates to help stop the button holes from stretching more. The fabric is not natural fiber but it's relatively soft and with the pointelle (more open) knit it is breathable. Over all the quality is okay. If the button holes stretch out that will pretty much ruin the shirt...so it all hinges on that over time.\n",

He is 6”3’ and he is pretty muscular which when buying shirts for him I need to make sure they are an appropriate length. This shirt fits him extremely well and is very flattering on his figure. When washing it didn’t shrink at all. The material is not too thin but not to thick, it is pretty breathable. The holes in the shirt aren’t big at all, which means you don’t need an under shirt underneath. For the price and quality of the product I do see it is fair.\n",

      "Content: Advice: GO for a extra size.Hello, I always have a sweet spot for this brand, however with this shirt unfortunately the size run small, even when it's my size. I am not fit (have belly) but this one feels a little tight to the body, it is breathable and stretch but tight. The colour is fantastic very pretty. The fabric is comfy but thin so watch out for that.One thing that dislike in this one is the neck, the design is like too high, like going all the way to the back.\n",
