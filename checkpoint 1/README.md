# Fake Review Detection Project

This project aims to detect fake reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. It is part of the **Winter of Code (DA-IICT)** initiative.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

Online reviews influence consumer decisions, but fake reviews undermine their trustworthiness. This project addresses the issue by:
- Preprocessing review datasets to prepare them for analysis.
- Applying machine learning models to identify fraudulent reviews.
- Evaluating performance metrics to ensure reliability.

## üèóÔ∏è **Preprocessing Steps**

### 1. **Import Libraries**
   Import essential libraries such as:
   - `pandas`: For data manipulation.
   - `nltk`: For text preprocessing.
   - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms.

### 2. **Load Dataset**
   Load the dataset from the `fakeReviewData.csv` file.

### 3. **Text Cleaning**
   Perform the following:
   - Remove digits, punctuation, and extra spaces.
   - Standardize text formatting.

### 4. **Remove Stopwords**
   Eliminate common stopwords using the `nltk.corpus` module.

### 5. **Lemmatization**
   Convert words to their base forms using the `WordNetLemmatizer`.

### 6. **Vectorization**
   Transform cleaned text into numerical features using **TF-IDF vectorization** to prepare data for machine learning models.
