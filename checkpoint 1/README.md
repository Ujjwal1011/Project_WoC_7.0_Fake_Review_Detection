# EDA and Preprocessing Code

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for the **Fake Review Detection Project**: `EDA.ipynb` and `Preprocessing code.ipynb`. These notebooks are part of the **Winter of Code (DA-IICT)** initiative and aim to detect fake reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## üìä **EDA.ipynb**

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The `EDA.ipynb` notebook focuses on understanding the dataset through various data visualization and analysis techniques.

### **Key Sections:**

1. **Preprocessing Data**
   - Import necessary libraries.
   - Load the dataset.
   - Clean and preprocess the text data.

2. **Checking Data Quality**
   - Verify if all words are in English.
   - Check for the presence of Unicode characters.

3. **Visualizing Data**
   - Generate pie charts, bar charts, and histograms to understand the distribution of categories, labels, and ratings.
   - Create word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in original and fake comments.

## üèóÔ∏è **Preprocessing code.ipynb**

### **Data Preprocessing**

The `Preprocessing code.ipynb` notebook is dedicated to preparing the dataset for machine learning models by performing various text preprocessing steps.

### **Key Sections:**

1. **Import Libraries**
   - Import essential libraries such as `pandas`, `nltk`, and `scikit-learn`.

2. **Load Dataset**
   - Load the dataset from the `fakeReviewData.csv` file.

3. **Text Cleaning**
   - Remove digits, punctuation, and extra spaces.
   - Standardize text formatting.

4. **Remove Stopwords**
   - Eliminate common stopwords using the `nltk.corpus` module.

5. **Lemmatization**
   - Convert words to their base forms using the `WordNetLemmatizer`.

6. **Vectorization**
   - Transform cleaned text into numerical features using **TF-IDF vectorization** to prepare data for machine learning models.
